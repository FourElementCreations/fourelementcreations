        <h1>Photo-editor Project: Introduction To Bitmap Images</h1>
        <p>As part of building a digital photo editor, it is important to understand the thing we will be editing, 
         more than just a digital photo, the bitmap image.</p>
        <p> In terms of digital images, there are two basic types: vector and bitmap, aka raster.  While both vector and bitmap
         can come in different file types, they work in fundamentally different ways.  
         
         <p>
            Vector images are made up of mathematical equations or expressions that describe shapes and lines in the image.
            These shapes and lines can either be filled with colors or gradients, or given a stroke, 
            i.e. a visualized line that runs along the path of the mathematically mapped line. One advantage of vector images is 
            that they are scalable, hence the name of a common vector file type, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). Scalable meaning 
            it doesn't pixelate when enlarged.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Bitmap images, on the other hand, map a 
            grid of squares called pixels, from "picture + element", and are the smallest element of a bitmap image. 
            Pixels contain specific color values and correspond to pixels on a display device such as a computer 
            monitor or smartphone screen.  the size and resolution of the image and the screen can affect how the image appears 
            and whether it looks sharp and clear or pixelated and blurry.

         </p>
         <p>As technology advances, the tendency over time has been for pixels in viewing devices to get smaller and also 
            for the number of pixels in bitmap files to increase as computers can process larger amounts of data, resulting in 
            higher resolution images.</p>
            <p>Super Mario enlarged, and at the original 16 px height.</p>
         <img id="mario" src="mario.png" width="100" height="123"><img src="mario.png" width="13" height="16">
         <p>
            Originally, pixels were only given a single bit of data. That is a 0 or a 1.
            They were either on or off, lit or dark.
            Nowadays each pixel can contain bytes of data,
            typically 3 bytes (24-bit) or 4 bytes (32-bit).
         </p>
         <p>
            This data, of course, is accessible, and it is by accessing pixel data and manipulating it that 
            digital photo-editing is possible.
         </p>


         <h2>
            What Data is Contained in a Bitmap Image?
         </h2>
         <p>
            Each pixel in a bitmap image is represented by a set of color values. 
            These values can be represented in different ways, depending on the file format of the image. 
            For example, in a 24-bit bitmap image, each pixel is represented by three values: 
            one for red, one for green, and one for blue (RGB). 
            As there are 256 possible values in a byte, these color values are often represented as numbers 
            between 0 and 255, with 0 being the darkest and 255 being the brightest.  
            The extra byte of data in 32-bit images (RGBA)
            is for the alpha channel, giving 256 possible values for a pixel's transparency. 
         </p>
         

      <p>In addition to the RGB, or RGBA values, bitmap images also contain information about the size of the image, 
         the resolution (or number of pixels per inch), and other metadata such as the date
         the image was created and the software used to create it.</p>

        <h2>What Can We Do with Bitmap Image Data?</h2> 
        
        <p>With the data contained in a bitmap image, we can perform a wide variety of image processing tasks. For example, 
         we can change the color values of individual pixels 
         to create special effects, or we can blur or sharpen specific areas of the image. 
         We can also use algorithms to automatically detect and correct problems with the image, 
         such as noise or distortion.</p>
         <p>In addition to image processing, bitmap image data can also be used for computer 
         vision tasks such as object recognition or face detection. By analyzing the color 
         values and patterns in the pixels, we can train machine learning algorithms to identify 
         specific objects or features within the image.</p> 
         <p>
            Conclusion

            Bitmap images are an important part of digital imaging, and understanding the data they 
            contain can help us create powerful image processing and computer vision applications. 
            In the next article, we'll take a brief look at the basic tools of building our editor:
            the HTML Canvas element and the JavaScript programming language.</p>

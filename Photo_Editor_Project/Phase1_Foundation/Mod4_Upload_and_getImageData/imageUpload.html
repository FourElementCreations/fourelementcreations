    <h2>Upload Image and Draw to Canvas</h2>
    <p>In this HTML markup, we have added an input element of type file, 
        which allows the user to select an image file. We have also created a canvas element with an id of "canvas".</p>

        <p>>Next, we will use JavaScript to add functionality to the file input element 
            and draw the selected image on the canvas.</p>
      <input type="file" id="fileInput" />
      <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
      <h1>Tutorial: Using JavaScript 'getImageData' Method For Image Manipulation</h1>
      <h2>Original png image</h2>
      <p>The image below is a bitmap displayed using an HTML image tag. 
        To access the data in the image we don't actually need to display it.
        The data usable in a bitmap image such as PNG or JPEG files are the red, green, blue, and alpha values
        (depending on the file type) of each pixel, but we can't access it yet.</p>

      <h2>Draw original image to canvas1</h2>
      <p> In order to access an image's data via JS, we 
        first need to draw the image to an HTML canvas element. This is supposed to be a security measure. The canvas doesn't need to be visible, 
        but for demonstration purposes we've redrawn the .png file the HTML canvas below.
      </p>
      <canvas id="canvas1" width="600" height="300"></canvas>
    
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
        var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
        if (canvas.getContext) {
          var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
          // drawing code here
        }
      }</code></pre>
      <!-- <h2>Draws image from canvas1 to canvas2 </h2>
      <canvas id="canvas2" width="600" height="300"></canvas> -->
      <h2>Draws average RGB values from squares in canvas1 to canvas3 </h2>
      <canvas id="canvas2" width="600" height="300"></canvas>
    
    </div>
    
       <script type="module" src="getImageData.js"></script>
